# Spotify Hit Songs :notes:
This project aims to find if the top Spotify songs over the last years have some common characteristics or features. <br>
Me and my group (@simone-mattia and @danielmontalbano) used a dataset found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/younver/spotify-top-200-dataset) and carried out some statistical analysis on the data to highlight any interesting insight. <br>
The projecet is enterely delveloped in R, using its main libraries, such as dplyr and Rmarkdown.
